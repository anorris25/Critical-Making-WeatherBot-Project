## This repository holds all files involved in the Motorized WeatherBot project for Critical Making, starting Fall 2024.

Modified files: pitt-rain-and-clouds.svg was made to make the project more "Pittsburghy". The rain disc features Pittsburgh's downtown skyline, and the cloud cover disc has the Cathedral of Learning.

Notes:
- All physical parts were already purchased/made.
- Latitude and longitute of the Cathedral of Learning is in the code. API key, wifi credentials, etc. will need to be determined and entered by project member.
- In the event that any soldering needs redone, make the wires on the limit switches ~2cm longer.
- The kite string on the wind disc had broken off. This can be reprinted, but right now it has a fragile piece of black paper glued on.
- Optional: You could figure out a way to adjust the UK measurements to US measurements (ex. Celsius to Degrees).
